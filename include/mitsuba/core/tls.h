/**
 * \brief Flexible platform-independent thread local storage class
 *
 * This class implements a generic thread local storage object that can be used
 * in situations where the new \c thread_local keyword is not available (e.g.
 * on Mac OS, as of 2016), or when TLS object are created dynamically (which
 * \c thread_local does not allow).
 *
 * The native TLS classes on Linux/MacOS/Windows only support a limited number
 * of dynamically allocated entries (usually 1024 or 1088). Furthermore, they
 * do not provide appropriate cleanup semantics when the TLS object or one of
 * the assocated threads dies. The custom TLS code provided by this class has
 * no such limits (caching in various subsystems of Mitsuba may create a huge
 * amount, so this is a big deal), and it also has the desired cleanup
 * semantics: TLS entries are destroyed when the owning thread dies \a or when
 * the \c ThreadLocal instance is freed (whichever occurs first).
 *
 * The implementation is designed to make the ``get()`` operation as fast as as
 * possible at the cost of more involved locking when creating or destroying
 * threads and TLS objects. To actually instantiate a TLS object with a
 * specific type, use the \ref ThreadLocal class.
 *
 * \sa ThreadLocal
